1. What is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?
Amazon VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. It allows you to control your network environment, including IP addresses, subnets, and security settings.

2. What are the key components of Amazon VPC?
Key components of Amazon VPC include subnets, route tables, network access control lists (ACLs), security groups, and Virtual Private Gateways (VPGs).

3. How does Amazon VPC work?
Amazon VPC enables you to create a private and secure network within AWS. You define IP ranges for your VPC, create subnets, and configure network security.

4. What are VPC subnets?
VPC subnets are segments of the VPC's IP address range. They allow you to isolate resources and control access by creating public and private subnets.

5. How can you connect your on-premises network to Amazon VPC?
You can establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection or use AWS Direct Connect to connect your on-premises network to Amazon VPC.

6. What is a VPC peering connection?
VPC peering allows you to connect two VPCs together, enabling resources in different VPCs to communicate as if they were on the same network.

7. What is a route table in Amazon VPC?
A route table defines the rules for routing traffic within a VPC. It determines how traffic is directed between subnets and to external destinations.

8. How do security groups work in Amazon VPC?
Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. They can be associated with instances and control their network access.

9. What are network access control lists (ACLs) in Amazon VPC?
Network ACLs are stateless filters that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. They provide an additional layer of security to control traffic flow.

10. How can you ensure private communication between instances in Amazon VPC?
